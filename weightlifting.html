                    <h4>Learn the basic principles of proper weightlifting technique and form to maximize gains and prevent injuries.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Weighlifting comes in many shapes an sizes, but on this page the focus will be strength training vs hypertrophy training. Both strength and 
                        hypertrophy training have their own reasons for use.<br>
                            <strong>Strength Training: </strong> lower reps, higher weights, focus on moving larger amounts of weight<br>
                                Strength training uses higher weights to force your muscles to work harder, not only training
                                your muscles for greater weight, but also your mind to be able to handle more weight.<br>
                            <strong>HyperTrophy Training: </strong> Higher reps, slightly lower weights, focusing on squeezing and stretching the muscle<br>
                                Hypertrophy training on the other hand focuses on the squeeze. With a better contraction,
                            pauses in your movement, or greater stretches in movements, your msucles can grow more in size, but may lack some strength to keep form perfect.

                    <h2>Form Factor</h2>
                    <h4>Learn why form is so important in weightlifting.</h4>
                    <p>When lifting, how you hold your form is very important to not only completing the exercise but also keeping yourself safe. When you go off the "path" or form of 
                        and exercise, The weight can effect other muscles and pull them out of place, leaving you at a higher risk for injury<br>
                            <strong>Concentric: </strong> When you are pushing or pulling the weight. Doing the hard work<br>
                                The concentric of the exercise, as mentioned, is the pushing or pulling of the weight. Imagine a bench press, where the weight is already on your chest.<br>
                                To get that weight off, you must contract your chest muscles, bringing your arms closer together, that the bar is pressed up. The concentric is where most strength gains are made<br>
                            <strong>Eccentric: </strong> Gravity is moving the weight, you must control it<br>
                                Now imagine that same bench press, but you are holding the weight up now, at the top of the rep. When gravity is bringing that weight down, you must slow it and control it on its way.<br>
                                If you go to fast, it will take extra strength to stop that speed at the bottom of the rep, so controlling the eccentric is key. The eccentric is where youre muscles are stretching, and<br>
                                a large part of how muscle hypertrophy is gained.

                    <h4>Squat Form</h4>
                    <p>Pictured below is an image of a squat, and the relative path the bar should take. Using this visual makes it easier to see how injuries may occur with improper form<br>
                        The first 2 images show the concentric, where your muscles are stretching and gravity is doing the moving work. The squat is a great exercise for your Quadsd and Glutes<br>
                        and you can see how they are both being stretched on the eccentric of the squat. When the bottom of the lift is hit, the lifter shoots back up ensuring the bar moves vertical the whole time<br>
                        This is the concentric, and the quads and gluted nwo contract to make him stand upright.
